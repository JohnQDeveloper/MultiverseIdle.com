        <h1>Welcome to Multiverse Idle - 2026 Alpha Edition</h1>
        Multiverse Idle is a game where you can explore different realms, collect resources, and build your character.
        <br /><br />
        It is a game that is intended to constantly evolve, through a mixture of open source contributions and the maintainer's.
        Enjoy competitive seasonal play or play in Perpetual for a persistent world.
        <br /><br />
        It should be noted that if you want a free to play experience, you will need to play both as Premium credits and such
        are only available in Perpetual mode.
        <br /><br />
        The game will be wiped on release of Beta and Early Access. So please keep that in mind.
